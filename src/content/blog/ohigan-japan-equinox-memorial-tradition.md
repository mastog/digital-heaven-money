## Origins and Customs

**Ohigan (お彼岸)** is an important traditional festival in Japan, observed during the seven-day period surrounding the **Spring Equinox (Shunbun, しゅんぶん)** and **Autumn Equinox (Shūbun, しゅうぶん)**. It is a time when people visit cemeteries (**墓参り, Hakama iri**) to pay respects to their ancestors (**ご先祖様, Gosenzo-sama**) and reflect on the impermanence of life.  

During Ohigan, families bring **offerings (供品, Kuhohin)** such as **flowers, fruits, and special traditional sweets** called **Ohagi (おはぎ) or Botamochi (ぼたもち)**. These are sweet **glutinous rice cakes (もち米, Mochigome)**, commonly filled with red bean paste. The terms **Ohagi** and **Botamochi** vary by region: the former is popular in **eastern Japan (Kantō)**, while the latter is more common in **western Japan (Kansai)**.  

## Ancestral Worship and Rituals  

Beyond grave visits, many households set up **ancestral tablets (位牌, Ihai)** at home and conduct **prayers (祈祷, Kitō)** to wish for their family's peace and prosperity. Families gather to remember their loved ones, reinforcing a sense of connection with their ancestors.  

The atmosphere during Ohigan is solemn yet heartwarming, emphasizing **family unity, remembrance, and gratitude**. The festival also serves as a reminder of **Buddhist teachings** on crossing from the world of suffering (此岸, Shigan) to enlightenment (彼岸, Higan).  

## Cultural Significance  

Ohigan has a deep historical and spiritual significance, showcasing **Japanese respect for ancestors and the importance of family bonds**. It is not only a day of **mourning** but also an opportunity for **self-reflection and togetherness**.  

In today’s fast-paced world, Ohigan provides a rare moment to slow down, cherish familial ties, and appreciate the cycle of life. This festival continues to be a meaningful part of **Japanese cultural heritage**.

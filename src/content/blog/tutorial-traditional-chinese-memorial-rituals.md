## Traditional Chinese Memorial Rituals for the Deceased
In traditional Chinese culture, there is a well-established set of rituals for honoring deceased family members. During the period from the first seven days 一七(Yi Qi),(one week) to the forty-ninth day 七七(Qi Qi), various memorial customs are observed.

一七(Yi Qi) (One Week): On the seventh day after the elderly person’s passing, the family holds a memorial ceremony to express their remembrance. This ceremony typically includes offerings, prayers, and burning of paper money. On this day, family members usually follow a vegetarian diet as a sign of respect for the deceased.

二七(Er Qi), 三七(San Qi), 四七(Si Qi), 五七(Wu Qi), 六七(Liu Qi) (Day 14, 21, 28, 35, 42): On these days, families may choose to conduct additional memorial ceremonies. Offerings and paper money may be prepared to express their grief and remembrance.

七七(Qi Qi) (Forty-Ninth Day): This is a significant milestone after the passing of a loved one. Families typically hold a grander memorial ceremony on this day to honor and remember the deceased. Offerings, burning of paper money, and prayers for the deceased’s well-being in the afterlife are common practices.

Other Memorial Traditions: In addition to the above-mentioned days, families may also perform memorial rituals during traditional festivals such as Qingming Festival, Zhongyuan Festival (Ghost Festival), and Han Yi Festival. Each of these festivals has specific customs for paying respects, which can be arranged according to local traditions.

## Steps for Conducting a Memorial Ritual

### **1. Prepare Offerings** 

Select offerings such as food, flowers, incense, and candles for the deceased. The food can be something the deceased enjoyed in their lifetime. White or yellow chrysanthemums are commonly chosen to symbolize purity and remembrance, while incense and candles are essential for the prayer ritual.

### **2. Clean the Gravesite** 

Before the ceremony, tidy up the surroundings of the grave. This includes sweeping fallen leaves, removing weeds, and repairing the tombstone if necessary.

### **3. Arrange the Offerings** 

Place the prepared offerings in front of the grave in an orderly manner. Typically, food is placed in the center, with flowers and incense on either side. The arrangement may follow local customs.

### **4. Perform the Worship Ritual** 

Family members take turns worshiping according to age hierarchy. Light incense, put hands together in prayer, and bow three times. During this moment, they may express their thoughts and emotions to the deceased in a solemn and respectful manner.

### **5. Burn Paper Money** 

After completing the prayer, family members burn paper money as a symbolic offering to the deceased. Care should be taken to control the fire to prevent accidents. During this ritual, they may also pray for the deceased’s peace and prosperity in the afterlife.

### **6. Conclude the Memorial Ceremony** 

Once the paper money has burned completely, the family gathers the offerings and prepares to leave. It is customary not to look back while leaving, as a sign of respect for the deceased.

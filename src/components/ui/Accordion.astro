  title: "Project Background",
  description:
    "To reduce environmental pollution caused by burning paper offerings and to prevent fire hazards, the government has implemented a policy prohibiting such practices. However, this restriction has also severed a traditional means for people to express their remembrance and emotions toward the deceased.\n\n" +
    "In order to preserve the essence of cultural heritage and human sentiment, while aligning with modern environmental policies, the government has commissioned us to develop an online memorial platform. This platform allows people to continue honoring their loved ones in a respectful, meaningful, and eco-friendly manner, ensuring that remembrance traditions can evolve with the times without losing their core values.\n\n" +
    "Furthermore, in response to globalization and the concept of a shared future for humanity, the government aims for this platform to embrace diverse cultures and religious traditions worldwide. By incorporating memorial customs from different countries and faiths, we provide a space where not only local citizens but also international users can commemorate their loved ones in ways that align with their cultural beliefs.\n\n" +
    "Through this initiative, we strive to balance tradition and innovation, heritage and sustainability, ensuring that love, remembrance, and respect transcend borders and endure across generations."

  title: "SDG",
  description:
    "Our online memorial platform deeply embodies the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals: SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and SDG 13 (Climate Action). We are committed, through technological innovation, to providing an environmentally friendly, safe, and inclusive digital memorial space. This initiative not only actively responds to government policies aimed at reducing environmental pollution (such as declining air quality) and fire hazards caused by the traditional burning of offerings—thereby helping to build safer and more resilient community environments (SDG 11)—but more importantly, it replaces high-carbon-emission traditional memorial rituals with modern methods of green remembrance and digital memorialization. This directly reduces greenhouse gas emissions, representing concrete action to address climate change (SDG 13). While respecting and accommodating diverse global cultures and religious beliefs, the platform protects and passes on valuable cultural heritage. It also ensures that these commemorative practices are conducted in an environmentally responsible manner that promotes long-term sustainable development. Ultimately, this drives society towards a smarter, more efficient, and more sustainable future, allowing love and memory to be passed on eternally while respecting our planet.\n\n"
